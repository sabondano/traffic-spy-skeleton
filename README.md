## Abstract

In this project the final objective was to use Ruby, Sinatra, and ActiveRecord to build a web traffic tracking and analysis tool.

The application lives on the Internet. It recieves data over HTTP from a simulation engine. The simulator will construct and transmit HTTP requests which include tracking data.

Imagine that I run a commercial website and embed JavaScript code which gets activated each time a page is viewed on my site. That JavaScript captures information about the visitor and the page they're viewing then, in the background, submits that data to this "TrafficSpy" application.

The application parses and stores that data.

Later, I visit your site and can view data about my traffic through a HTML interface.

## Learning Goals

* Understand how web traffic works
* Dig into HTTP concepts including headers, referrers, and payload
* Design a normalized SQL-based database structure
* Use ActiveRecord to interface with the database from Ruby
* Practice fundamental database storage and retrieval
* Understand and practice HTTP verbs including GET, PUT, and POST
* Practice using fundamental HTML and CSS to create a usable web interface
